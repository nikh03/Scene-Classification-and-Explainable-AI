# Scene-Classification-and-Explainable-AI

In this project, I have trained deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) and Residual blocks to detect the type of scenery in an image. This project could be practically used for detecting the type of scenery in an image. This project could be practically used for detecting the type of scenery from satellite images.
 
  The input contains the 17034 color images belonging to 6 categories viz. Building, forest, glacier, mountain, sea and street. From which I have predicted that the particular scene/image will be falling in one of the above categories.

Then analysis is done by using GRAD-CAM that how exactly the model has predicted the image in the following categories with the help of Heat-map.
